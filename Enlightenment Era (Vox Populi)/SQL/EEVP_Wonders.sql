The site houses castles, Iyasu’s Palace, stables and three churches amongst other rooms. Before the building of the fort in about 1635 the emperors of Ethiopia travelled and lived off the land, resting in tents. Emperor Fasilides broke this tradition by founding the city of Gondar and establishing it as his capital. Upon founding the city Fasilides then instructed the creation of ‘Fasil Gemb’ - Fasilides Castle. Since his death later emperors expanded on Fasil Gemb to eventually cover roughly 70,000 square meters of fortified space. The historian Thomas Pakenham visited the site during the 1950’s, noting that among the halls and palaces were what appeared to be pavilions and kiosks of the imperial city therein.

Along with Kärnan, another Danish fortress situated across the 4km wide Øresund, it was built predominantly to control the entrance to the Baltic Sea. This allowed for the Danish King to demand Øresundstolden, or Sound Dues. This was where all ships entering the Baltic had to pay a tax to the Danish king. If they refused, the cannons on either side of the sound would open fire on the ship and sink it. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1585 the castle was rebuilt under Frederick II of Denmark. This is when the castle became the large Rennaisance castle which it is now. In 1639 the castle was rebuilt by King Christian IV, after a fire ten years earlier.

The palace served as the official residence of the Ottoman sultans for nearly four centuries of their rule, lasting until Sultan Abdul Mecid I moved the court to a newly-built palace further up the Bosphorous in 1856. Topkapi Palace is in fact more of a walled village than a palace, with several small buildings and many courtyards as opposed to one central structure. The site is home to many relics and artefacts collected both by the Sultans and following the end of the Ottoman empire when the palace was turned into a Museum. Among these are relics sacred to the Islamic world, including a door to the Great Mosque of Mecca, as well as what is said to be the cloak and sword of the prophet Muhammed. Other items include many collected from Silk Road trade, such as various pieces of Chinese porcelain from across four different dynasties of rule, and a collection of Islamic weaponry spanning approximately 13 centuries.

The Qianlong Emperor ordered the construction to be stopped just after the eighth storey was built. On the first day and fifteenth day of each lunar month, Empress Dowager Cixi visited the tower to offer incense and pray. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] The Summer Palace is a complex of gardens, lakes and buildings that was constructed in Beijing under the order of the Qianlong Emperor, of the Qing Dynasty, in 1749.  The project required the creation of artificial lakes in the area, as the palace and surrounding farmland required waterworks and irrigation.  The palace''s design was based off of various aspects of China''s myths, legends, and natural and man-made wonders.  The palace fell into decline along with the Qing dynasty, and was damaged by the British and French during the Second Opium War.  After the fall of Qing, the complex fell into the possession of the former imperial family, now powerless.  It was opened to the public in 1924, after the last emperor, Puyi, was expelled.  Since 1953, the government of the People''s Republic of China have renovated the palace, which is now a World Heritage Site.'),
