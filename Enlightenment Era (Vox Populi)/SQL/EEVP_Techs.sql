Many romantic thinkers were great artists, musicians, and writers, who sought to elicit intense emotion as a means to see the world around them. These thinkers would come to shape the political ideas of liberalism and radicalism which contrast so deeply with the pessimistic and cynical ideas of conservatism and realism of the modern age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Romanticism reached its peak during the 19th Century, at the height of the Industrial Revolution. Artists and writers from England to Russia all celebrated in an idealistic view of humankind. Its emphasis on imagination and individual heroism was a popular distraction from the rapid changes heralded by an age dominated by global and urban empires seeking wealth and gain. It criticised authority and intellectual objectivity, and gave society a sense of quality and unity which would come to inspire ideals of the nationalism and fraternity.'),

('TXT_KEY_TECH_EE_SOVEREIGNTY_DESC', 'Sovereignty is the political concept of supreme authority. Although in the modern sense sovereignty is usually associated with the highest authority of or within a state, it can also refer to the highest means of any individual to take independent action. This was the traditional sense of the word during the Middle Ages, when sovereignty was merely translated as being the legal or assertive capability of any individual to act independent of others. It was not until the Age of Enlightenment and the Peace of Westphalia that sovereignty became regarded legally as being the power of states to act autonomously of one another.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sovereignty first became popularised by the idea of the “Social Contract,” which was first conceived by the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes as a means to explain the inception of society. Hobbes stipulated that, in order to avoid a state of perpetual conflict between mankind, or a state of “war of all against all,” individuals consent to giving up certain freedoms and benefits to an absolute and indivisible authority that can compel mankind to act in the common interest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On this basis was created the ideal of Absolute Monarchy, which would be practiced in states such as Sweden and Prussia during the 17th and 18th centuries. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, however, would conceive of the notion of popular sovereignty, which instead considers supreme authority as being legitimately held by the people, and merely entrusted into a government to be exercised. It was on the basis of this popular sovereignty that nations such as the United States of America and the French Republic were conceived.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Today, most legitimate forms of sovereignty are either popular (as in a Presidential Republic, or as in the Kingdoms of Belgium and Sweden, and the State of Japan) or Parliamentary (as in a Constitutional Monarchy or Parliamentary Republic). In the case of the latter, sovereignty is retained by a supreme authority (the people or the monarch), but exercised on that authority’s behalf by a Parliament, which is usually democratically elected. In this way, most forms of sovereignty are, at least hypothetically, de facto exercised by popular consent, differing greatly from the indivisible form of which Hobbes first conceived.'),

Besides obviously being armed with some form of weapon (traditionally things like cannon or rams), warships can also withstand more damage and are much more maneuverable than something like a merchant or passenger vessel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As naval technologies have advanced, so has the warship.  Galleys and triremes were early forms of warships capable of ramming enemy vessels, but usually combat was performed by the army onboard.  However, once cannon became capable of quick reloads, large sail-driven ships were employed which held rows of cannon along each side of the craft. Eventually these wooden ships were given up for ones made of iron and steel, and sails were abandoned for steam and nuclear power. While modern warships bear little resemblance to the earliest galleys, they still keep to the same basic design principles - be capable of destroying the other guy first, before he can take out you.'),
